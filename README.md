# Project 1. 
Grey Wolf Optimizer based tuning of Hybrid LQR-PID controller for foot trajectory control.In this report the hybrid LQR-PID controller is tuned using a Grey Wolf optimizer which is then compared with the results obtained from Particle Swarm Optimization. The principal goal of this report is to compute the LQR controller parameters (Q and R weight matrices) and the PID controller gains(kp, ki and kd). 


# Final Project. 
The diagram of the cart given to us consists of two pendulums suspended from the cables attached to the crane. The crane moves along a one-dimensional track and it behaves as a frictionless cart with mass M actuated by an external force F that constitutes the input of the system. There are two loads suspended from cables attached to the crane. The loads have mass 𝑚1 and 𝑚2, and the lengths of the cables are 𝑙1 and 𝑙2 respectively.
